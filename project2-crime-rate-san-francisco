Question 1: Convert the San Francisco dataset, which you can also find here, https://cocl.us/sanfran_crime_dataset, into a pandas dataframe,like the one shown in the instructions, that represents the total number of crimes in each neighborhood.
# import the libraries needed
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd

# read the dataset into a pandas dataframe
df_SF = pd.read_csv('https://cocl.us/sanfran_crime_dataset')

# confirm it has been completed
print('Dataset on crime rate in San Francisco downloaded and read into a pandas dataframe!')

df_SF.head()

# Let's group by district
d=df_SF[["PdDistrict", "Location"]]
df_Neighbourhood = d.groupby("PdDistrict").count()
df_Neighbourhood.index.name='Neighbourhood'
df_Neighbourhood.rename(columns={'PdDistrict':'Neighbourhood','Location':'Count'}, inplace=True)
df_Neighbourhood= df_Neighbourhood.reindex(["CENTRAL", "NORTHERN", "PARK", "SOUTHERN", "MISSION", "TENDERLOIN", "RICHMOND", "TARAVAL", "INGLESIDE", "BAYVIEW"])
df_Neighbourhood=df_Neighbourhood.reset_index()

df_Neighbourhood

!conda install -c conda-forge folium=0.5.0 --yes
import folium

print('Folium installed and imported!')

!wget --quiet https://cocl.us/sanfran_geojson
!pip install wget

print('SF_geo file downloaded!')

SF_GEO=r'sanfran_geojson' # # geojson file

# Define San Francisco Map with folium.Map
SF_Map=folium.Map(location=[37.7749, -122.4194], zoom_start=12)

# Choropleth
SF_Map.choropleth(
    geo_data=SF_GEO,
